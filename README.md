# Basic Markdown Learning-

## What is Markdown?
<p>Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.</p>

## Main use of Markdown:
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension used in Gists, comments in issues and pull requests.

## Basic syntax:

### 2. How to write:
```
Sometimes you want ordered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
```

### 4. How to write:
```
# This is used for largest heading.

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings.
## This is used for second-tier heading.
### This is a third-tier heading.

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> It's never late to get started.

### 5. How to write:
```
If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`. 

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:
```
```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 6. How to write:
```
If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @Isha2103 — loved your readme!
For task lists:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It works in Pull Requests, too!

### 7. How to write:
```
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```
